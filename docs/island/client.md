# Client Island

A client island is a component which is mounted and rendered on the client side, but can also have a pre-rendered placeholder generated by the server.

Before a component can be used on the client you must first reference it in the `/app/manifest.tsx`, simply import the class to that file and the [vite plugin](../setup/vite.md#plugins) will do the reset, however we also recommend exporting the component itself direct to prevent typescript from complaining.

```ts
import type { ClientIslandManifest } from "htmx-router";

import { TimeSince } from "~/component/client/time";
const Client = {
	TimeSince
};

export default Client as ClientIslandManifest<typeof Client>;
```

Once the component is referenced in the manifest you must use it from the manifest for it to be re-rendered on the client.
```jsx
import Client from "~/manifest.tsx";

export function loader() {
  return <Client.TimeSince time={Date.now()}>
    A server rendered placeholder that will be replaced once the client mounts
  </Client.TimeSince>
}
```

## Client Mounting

You must also import the manifest in your `entry.client.ts` or else the components will never mount.
```ts title="entry.client.ts"
import "~/manifest";

// ... the rest of your entry

// vite complains if the client entry doesn't have a default export
export default {};
```

## Static Generation

If you define the client in your `htmx.config.json` you can have it statically generate the server and client versions of the manifest which you can import directly instead of relying on the vite plugin.

```json title="htmx.config.json"
{
  "framework": "react",
  "client": {
    "source": "./app/manifest.tsx",
    "output": {
      "server": "./app/manifest.server.tsx",
      "client": "./app/manifest.client.tsx",
    }
  }
}
```
