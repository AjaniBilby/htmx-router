# Islands

Island are a way of rendering content out of directly by the server in the response.

Server islands are a way to lazy load dynamic content on a mostly static page allowing the base page to be cached universally (not specific to a session) - and client islands to parse data to the browser to render the component on the client for higher interactivity.
