# Setup

The setup for this router is slightly more involved than most other routers because it exposes a lot of it's internals to make it adaptable to your project and it's needs, but it also means you need to connect a few hoses before it can start running.

Because of that we've broken it up into three sections: [vite](./vite.md), [server](./server.md), and [rendering](./rendering.md).
